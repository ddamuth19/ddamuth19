## About Me

Iâ€™m a data science professional with a strong foundation in applied mathematics and hands-on experience in building, training, and interpreting machine learning models. My current work spans across Python (PyTorch, Seaborn, scikit-learn) and R (tidymodels, ggplot2), with a particular interest in:

- Statistical Modeling & Interpretation  
- Deep Learning with PyTorch  
- Time Series & Predictive Modeling  
- Network Analysis & Graph Models  

I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my experience and continue to grow in a dynamic, technically challenging environment.
